      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>We at TEAM2-NJ2 strive to make quality education affordable to the masses. Over the years, the cost of
        education has increased many folds to make it beyond the reach of many. You may be appalled to learn that even
        in most developed nations students resort to prostitution to pay up for their college tuition fees. We want to
        remove this financial barrier to a good education. The only barrier to education must be an individualâ€™s thirst
        for knowledge.</p>

      <p>We believe that by widening the reach of education, by making it freely available, so much can be achieved.</p>
        <p>And this journey started in June, 2020, by a simple idea that "wouldn't it be great,to have a web-portal, with simple
        articles and blogs for programming languages and technologies, just like a friend would share his/her idea!", and TEAM2-NJ2 was born.</p>

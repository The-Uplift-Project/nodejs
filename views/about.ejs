              Our Vision & Mission
          </h3>
          <p>
            We at TEAM2-NJ2 strive to make quality education affordable to the masses. Over the years, the cost of
            education has increased many folds to make it beyond the reach of many. You may be appalled to learn that even
            in most developed nations students resort to prostitution to pay up for their college tuition fees. We want to
            remove this financial barrier to a good education. The only barrier to education must be an individualâ€™s thirst
            for knowledge.

              Our Origin Story
          </h3>
          <p>
            We believe that by widening the reach of education, by making it freely available, so much can be achieved.</p>
            <p>And this journey started in June, 2020, by a simple idea that "wouldn't it be great,to have a web-portal, with simple
            articles and blogs for programming languages and technologies, just like a friend would share his/her idea!", and TEAM2-NJ2 was born.

              Our Testimonials
          </h3>
          <p>
             <strong>Kumari Shivani Singh - </strong> Being an active participant of The Uplift Project, I have learnt a lot from it. From understanding key concepts of Nodejs to implementing it and contributing it to an open source team project, I have grown everyday as a developer. Overall It was very exciting experience. I have learnt to work in a team and deliver project inside deadline. I am really looking forward to be a part of something like this again.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ritika Jaiswal - </strong> I have been here at The Uplift Project as a participant in Nodejs track and this was a ravishing experience for me, I have learned and implemented my skills on various tasks assigned to me. I thoroughly enjoyed this overall journey of 3 months where we have worked as a team and have successfully created a project that will be helpful for others to enhance their learning experience.
